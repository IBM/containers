Many of the exercises in the above list use the same application
called "guestbook", which can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/guestbook).
This is done to show how an application may change over time as it
leverages all of the features available in Cloud Native environments.

If you find a bug in any of these exercises please feel free to open
an Issue or Pull Request agaist the specific repository.
